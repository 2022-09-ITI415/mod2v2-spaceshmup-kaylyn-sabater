 For this project, I haven't reached my final goal because I lacked the coding capability to get there, but I can highlight some of the attempts I have made to add new features.

 My first feature added in this game is the new weapon variations. I have tampered with the damage and shooting spead of the initial weapons and I also defined the other weapons including the laser, phaser, and missile.

 - My shortcoming for this feature was the ability of the missile to be able to lock onto the nearest target.  I have sat through the lab sessions to try and to develop the hhoming missile script that will lock on to the nearest game object and make sure its an enemy.  That is as far as the development got. The script is capable of identifying the nearest target but the projectile isn't coded to track and hit its target.

My second attempt at a new feature is an additional enemy, enemy_5.  This enemy isn't all that unique, I wanted to add an new enemy to the field with a high chance of dropping a power up.  I struggled with the coding aspect and as a result, the gameobject will pause and disappear of the screen after a certain amount of time.
